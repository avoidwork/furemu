# Furemu

Furemu is a progressively enhanced template. Need a light weight, but impressive landing page?
Start with furemu, and add in what's missing for your project.

## Installation
1. git clone https://github.com/avoidwork/furemu.git
2. customize `index.html`
3. customize `js/app.js`
4. customize `css/style.css`
5. (optional) add another library/framework into the mix

# How does the routing work?
To create routes, you need to have an anchor with an href that matches an Element's id. `dom-router`
will scan the HTML on load, determine what routes are available, and setup the document with the required
CSS classes.
